                  <p>Sunrises are sometimes overlooked. Because not everyone gets to experience them. You either have to party all night long in order to see a sunrise. Or you have to wake up really early. Depending on where in the world you live and what season it is.
  
                      They are never at the same time. Sunrises move slowly from minute to minute. Backward or forwards into the day.</p>

                      <p>The sunshine has warmth in its brilliance, reflecting a shimmer from the ends of my eyelashes, deep brown though they are. It invites my eyes to rest, so that I may see the strong rays even when I appear to be sleeping. It's the kind of sunshine that comes at any time of year, illuminating summer meadows and alpine slopes all the same. I wish there was a word for the feeling it brings, for now I'm calling it "sunjoy."</p>
